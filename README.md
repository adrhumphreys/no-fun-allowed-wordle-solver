# Wordle solver

_I actually hate fun and games_

This is just a basic solver where you can enter you word, tap each letter to say if it's a hit, miss, or incorrect and then get a list of possible remaining words

There's no weighting applied to the words recommended and no score, it mainly gives you all the options you could take with your current info
